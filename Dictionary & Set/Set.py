# Unhashable" refers to an object that cannot be hashed, meaning its hash value cannot be computed or used for operations like storing in a hash table or set.

# In programming, hashability is a property of an object that allows it to be used as a key in a hash-based data structure, such as a dictionary or set. For an object to be hashable, it must:

# 1. Be immutable (its state cannot change after creation)
# 2. Have a hash value that can be computed (using a hash function)
# 3. Have a hash value that is consistent across different executions of the program

# Examples of unhashable objects include:

# - Lists (because they are mutable)
# - Dictionaries (because they are mutable)
# - Sets (because they are mutable)
# - Custom objects that are mutable or do not implement the __hash__() method

# In contrast, examples of hashable objects include:

# - Integers
# - Floats
# - Strings
# - Tuples (if they contain only hashable objects)
# - Custom objects that are immutable and implement the __hash__()Â method
