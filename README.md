| `ElseIf_TernaryOperators.py` | Conditional logic using `if-else` and ternary operators |
| `conditional_statements.py` | Practice with control flow |
| `firstProgram.py`          | My very first Python script! |
| `InputOutput.py`           | Handling user input and output |
| `Logical_Operator.py`      | Working with logical operators |
| `String.py`                | String manipulation and methods |
| `TernaryOperator.py`       | More ternary operator practice |
